# I added some comments
# (1) In principle all filenames and directory names should be lowercase and not include any spaces.
# (2) As you already correctly suggest: This repo should only be about the code. All other stuff should be removed.folder of original.py files (the program itself?)?
# (3) I added another suggestion for restructuring

suggested file structure:
	root
	|
	|
	|
	\
	 Code
	 # should be a meaningful name like "biopax2pnml"
	   |
	   \
	    Tests (contains tests)
	   |
	   \
	    Properties (contains validator and structural.py, clasifier.py = duplicate, can be deleted)
	   |
	   \
	    folder of original.py files (the program itself?)?
	    # That stuff should probably be just in the folder which you currently call "Code"
	|
	\
	 Papers (could be other repository, contains papers of Timo)
	 # Let's just remove them and exchange papers in Zotero or something similar.
	|
	\
	 Biopax Files (.owl)
	|
	\
	 Petrinets (contains output pnml files)
	 # Do these really need to be in the repository?
	|
	\
	 Files (Could be other repository)
	 # I agree, that should not be in this repository.
	   |
	   \
	    paper (move files up or have in this folder?)


# Second suggestion for a new structure
#Luc: this looks more like a program, so I suppose this is better
	root
	|
	\
	 main.py # (formerly biopax2pnml.py)
	|
	\
	 model
		|
		\
		 petrinet.py
		|
		\
		 # (maybe additional model classes)
	|
	\
	 converter
		|
		\
		 biopax.py # (maybe rename it?)
		|
		\
		 converters.py
		|
		\
		 # (mayby additional converter classes)
	|
	\
	 properties # (maybe rename it)
		# Maybe we should rethink the structure of the classes in this
		# module to avoid duplication of functionality.
		|
		\
		 classifier.py
		|
		\
		 validator.py
		|
		\
		 structural.py #Luc: this is a duplicate
	|
	\
	 export
		|
		\
		 pnml.py
	|
	\
	 test
		# Mirror structure of root directory and write tests for every file.
