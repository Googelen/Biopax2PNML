Implement macro modeling (arcs both ways and add transitions together)
Check boundness (maxial number of tokens) (static)
Check livelyness (are all transitions fired?)
Check reversibility: is the initial state reachable again?
Page 14 contains all kind of analysis possible:
easy ones:
ORD
CON
SCF

A net with boundary nodes cannot be bounded and live at the same time.
P-invariance
T-invariance (requires matrices)

page 18 abount finding minimal invariance is not that handy I think, 
because we do not know how the petrinet acctually looks like, 
there may be missing arcs and then this has no meaning

Finding deadlocks is do-able

Reachability graph neccesairy? they state it becomes very computation intensive and large

are we going to do everything on page 29? that is all of the above (summary of validations)
Can we use their tool for analysis? (Sno08 == snoopy apparently)

H5:
Problem:
stochastica approach uses positive and negative interactions which we do not have implemented

I lost it...
I think they use a lot of math to calculate how many tokens should be used where
But seems very hard to do 

Suggestions of static analysis:
boundness
livelyness
reversability
dead locks
p and t invariance
If we have spare time some options from page 14
