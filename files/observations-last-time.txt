Observations of the last time:

Database connection with "UnificationXref"tag
Converts database ID to rdf id

With "SmallMoleculeReference" mapped into other rdf id

With another "SmallMolecule" mapped into rdf resource as many times as it occurs
This resource has different identifiers for the same "SmallMoleculeReference", so e.g. if 'water' is involved 3 times, it has 3 different resources

This is used in the "BiochemicalReaction", which is used in the program of Timo

Problems:
Same substance is mapped as many times as it occurs to different id's
BiochemicalReaction tag can have multiple 'right' or 'left' places, but the SPARQL query only returns the 1 pair
Also, 'right' is the postplace and left is the 'preplace'
Also the 'Catalysis' tag has a controlled and controller substance, which is not part of the SPARQL query

SPARQL = rdf query language
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/

I think we should rewrite the query or extend it.
Possible problem:
  In the query it returns an array, but is it possible to be longer than 4 items?
