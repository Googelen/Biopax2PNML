Hypothesis:
How can generated petrinets from biopax be validated to become executable pathways
(Fancy words)

    [Maybe a more modest proposal:
     What properties of petri nets can be determined with information from biopax?]

Paragraphs:
Earlier work/intro
Some talk about the work from timo

How to do such a thing
How are we going to do this

Static validation
explain what we have done statically

Dynamic validation
Explain what we have done dynamically
Not yet done

Improving the generated petrinet
I do not know if this is a good idea, because maybe this will not work, but if eventually this should happen right?
Also, not a clue how to do this

Conclusion
What have we done
